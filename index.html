<h1 id="C1">Introduction</h1>  
<p align="justify">
  Every Scholar either in the undergraduate program or in the research program has trouble with some of the basic components in daily use. 
  The most irritating component is the transistor because it is difficult to identify its types: NPN, PNP, N-Channel, P-Channel, E-MOSFET, or D-MOSFET, and its pins (EBC).
  The parameters that irritate the most are the current gain value or IDSS, which can significantly impact calculations.
  <br><br>
  This device will include a user-interface system that provides the current gain or IDSS value, as well as the collector cut-off current (ICE0) 
  and collector residual current (ICEs) simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>Design Requirements:</h3>
<p align="justify">
  To proceed with this objective, we will be provided with the essential components, and other parts will be printed using the 
  <b><u>Ultimaker</u></b> 3D printing machine in the Fabrication Lab and Workshop Lab.
  <br><br>
  Following components are considered for design requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>LCD Display with 16 by 2 Character</b> <i>(for displaying results)</i></li>

<h3>High Level System Diagram:</h3>
<p align="justify">
  The following circuit diagram has been created in <i>Fritzing</i> application software.
  <br>
  This became our finalized circuit design after receiving suitable components and working hard on coding for having one micro-controller.

<h3><center>Description of Principle of Operation</center></h3>

<p align="justify">
In this circuit, 5V DC power supply has been connected through USB(MINI) is connected to the circuit and then we insert a component in testport.
One testport pin is selected as the positive side of the device and connected directly to VCC. The other testport pin is selected as the negative side of
the device. The negative side is connected with the 680 resistor to GND. With field-effect transistors, the state of the device depends on the voltage
of the gate. The Tristate pin is first connected with the 680 resistor for 5 ms to the GND side and the voltage at the negative side is measured.
After that, the voltage of the negative side is measured again during the Tristate pin switched as input (High Impedance). Then the assumed gate is
connected with the 680 resistor for 5 ms to the VCC side and the voltage on the negative side is measured again. If the measured voltage is lower
than the first measurement result, this circuit will be assumed as the right one. Then the voltage is measured again with currentless Tristate pin.
</p>
<br><br>


<p align="justify">
When the Arduino code is uploaded in the Arduino UNO, LCD Display will be turned on, by inserting the component and by pressing the test button.
The Testor then will start their calculations through resistors and display the results on the screen.

      RISC architecture, good performance and low power consumption. It has 3 built-in timers, of which two are 8-bit timers and 
      the third one is a 16-bit timer. It’s operating voltages are from 1.8V to 5.5V.

      This component adds a readable interface to our project. LCD is short for liquid crystal display and basically a display unit 
      uses liquid crystals to form a visual image. When current is applied to these crystals, they become opaque, blocking the 
      backlight that resides behind the screen. As a result that particular area will be dark compared to the others. And this is 
      how the characters are displayed on the screen. If you look closely, you can see tiny rectangles for each character on the 
      display and the pixels that make up a character. Each of these rectangles is a grid of 5×8 pixels.

      superseded by USB Type. Here in the project, we are using the Mini USB in order to power the device. It is also used for 
      communication between devices. It has high speed transfer rate of 480 Mbps with on-the-go feature.

      and testing into a single production phase and save money, rather than requiring a separate programming stage prior to 
      assembling the system. Another advantage is that production can always use the latest firmware, and new features, as well as 
      bug fixes, can be implemented without delay. With these pins, we can also connect other devices for our project. It also

<h3>Connectivity of Components by Protocols:</h3>

<p align="justify">
  Two main protocols have been used in the circuitry of this project.
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>UART Protocol</li>
  <li>SPI Protocol</li>
</ol>

<br><br>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <u><b>UART Protocol:</b></u>
    <p align="justify">
      UART stands for <b>Universal Asynchronous Reception Transmission.</b> This protocol permits the Arduino to communicate with serial devices 
      through the pins <i>D0 (Rx)</i> & <i>D1 (Tx)</i>.
      <br><br>
      They are used to interface devices like Arduino with the laptop through a USB cable. In simple words, an FTDI chip makes
      it super easy to convert a USB signal to the UART signal understood by the microcontrollers.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<br><br>


<li>
  <u><b>SPI Protocol:</b></u>
  <p align="justify">
    There is no trace of communication protocol (most popular I2C or SPI) found within the components in our project. However, when our device is
    connected to other devices like a computer for the purpose of bootloading the microcontroller or programming our device, it uses the SPI communication
    protocol. This is because we have integrated ICSP headers into the PCB.
    <br><br>
    SPI is a protocol that transfers data serially between two microcontrollers and other devices. It is a synchronous interface, meaning it uses a clock
    signal to transfer and receive data. In our project, the clock functionality is handled by a crystal oscillator.
    <br><br>
    This interface uses <b>MISO</b>, <b>MOSI</b>, <b>SCLK</b>, <b>CS</b>, <b>RST</b>, and <b>GND</b> for communication. We bootloaded the microprocessor
    using ICSP headers, which relied on the SPI protocol.

  <h3>Electrical Schematic</h3>
  <img src="images/Electrical Schematic.jpg" width="400" height="600">
</center>

<br><br>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">
  From the beginning of this project, our circuitry is based on <i>Arduino</i>. Hence, the schematic has been created similar to that of Arduino 
  in which <b>ATMEGA328P</b> microcontroller of <i>SMD</i> package has been used along with LEDs, capacitors, measurement-purpose resistors, and a crystal oscillator.
  In addition to these, male connectors have been attached for our components and for uploading the code using the <i>FTDI Cable</i> and for <i>Bootload</i>.
  <br><br>
  We also used a USB port for power supply, testing ports for component placement, and a test button. For visual output, we used a 16x2 character LCD 
  to display the tested component parameters and its schematic symbol.

  <h3>PCB Layout</h3>
  <img src="images/Electrical PCB.jpg" width="400" height="600">
</center>

<br><br>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p align="justify">
  <i>
    <u>Firstly</u>, we both tried but found that we were totally unfamiliar with <i>Eagle</i> software. The FABLAB team introduced us to its basics.
    <br><br>
    When switching from schematic to board layout, we struggled with component placement due to limited knowledge and inexperience. 
    Again, the FABLAB team helped guide us through it.
  </i>
  <br><br>
  <u>Secondly</u>, we initially tried to keep the circuit on a single layer. But due to complexity, we switched to a double-layer layout 
  to ease routing and create a compact design.
  <br><br>
  <u>Third</u>, when transitioning to a double-layer PCB, we faced issues such as shifting traces between <b>Top</b> and <b>Bottom layers</b>,
  adjusting <i>drill sizes</i>, and managing the spacing between adjacent traces and vias. The <b>FABLAB</b> team continuously guided us while 
  we worked under the supervision of <i>Dr. Asim Samejo</i>.

<h3>Burning the Bootloader</h3>
<img src="images/Boot Load.jpg" width="400" height="600">

<br><br>

<h3>Procedure of Burning Bootloader</h3>
<p align="justify">
  <b>Bootloader is an initial piece of code (usually 512 bytes) which runs whenever a microcontroller is powered up or resets.</b>
  It also looks for external inputs, i.e. uploading a new program. 
  <b>Similarly, in case of no input, it executes the program that was uploaded previously.</b>
  <br><br>
  <i><u>Bootloading a device requires the following basic components:</u></i>
</p>

<br>

<ol type="1" align="left">
  <li>Arduino IDE</li>
  <li>Device (to be bootloaded)</li>
  <li>USB-AVR-ISP (<i>option in IDE and is optional</i>)</li>
</ol>


<b><u>Procedure:</u></b>
<p><i>We adopted the following procedure to bootload our project in coordination with Sir Nadir Ali.</i></p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Open the bootloader firmware from Arduino IDE by following the path: <b>File → Examples → ArduinoISP.</b></li>
  <li>Select the model of programming board by following the path: <b>Tools → Board → Arduino Uno.</b></li>
  <li>Select the <b>Upload</b> button in the IDE and proceed to load the <b>ArduinoISP sketch to your programmer board.</b></li>
</ol>

<br>

<h3>Challenges in Booting Up</h3>

<p align="justify">
  We faced an issue during bootloading our project. In order to bootload the circuit, two steps were necessary:
  <br><br>
  The first step was to check the program we were using to bootload — fortunately, this was not the issue as the program came directly from the Arduino IDE.
  <br><br>
  The second step was to analyze the hardware circuit. Bootloading problems are usually due to either the program or the circuit. Since the program was verified,
  we investigated the circuit. After deep analysis and tests, we realized that the <b>crystal oscillator was not soldered properly</b>.
  <br><br>
  Once we re-soldered the oscillator correctly, we were able to bootload our circuit successfully — as documented in our reference image.

<h3>Demonstration of Operational the Circuit</h3>
<p align="justify">
  In our project, besides the microcontroller requirements, <b>four other main components</b> are added to the PCB:
  <br><br>
  The <b>USB (Mini)</b> is used to power the circuit with approximately 5V. A <b>test button</b> is pressed when the device under test (component) 
  is placed in the test port, or after a test is done, to test the next component. 
  <br><br>
  <b>Six measurement-purpose resistors</b> are added (three 680 ohm and three 470 kilo ohm). A 16x2 character <b>LCD</b> is used to display results.
  <br><br>
  In this way, we created a fully operational circuit running on only 5V.
</p>

<h3>Flow Code of the Software Design</h3>

<h3>Description of Flow Code</h3>
<p align="justify">
  First measurement is done with a 680 Ω base resistor switched to VCC. If the voltage at the base resistor is too low, the 470 kΩ resistor is
  taken instead. If the voltage of the collector sinks below 1.6 V when the 680 Ω base resistor is connected to VCC, it must be an NPN, 
  N-Channel MOSFET, or Thermistor/Triac.
  <br><br>
  With two simple tests, a Thyristor or Triac can be identified. If the gate pin resistor is connected for 10 ms to GND and then made currentless,
  the current at the anode should stay. If the anode resistor is then short connected to GND and reconnected to VCC, the Thyristor should not trigger
  again (no current).
  <br><br>
  Please keep in mind that only low-power Thyristors can be tested, because the holding current of the tester can reach only 6 mA. If both tests
  confirm a Thyristor, further tests with reverse polarity are done to exclude or confirm a Triac.
</p>

<h3>Design Consideration</h3>
<p align="justify">
  The idea of the design has been taken from the reference website, and the dimensions have been set in <b>millimetres.</b> 
  According to the height and length of the <b><i>PCB with mounted LCD</i></b>, the dimensions have been decided, and upper and lower parts have been 
  built. Inside the enclosure, there will be the <i>dedicated PCB</i> to connect the power supply internally. 
  <i>We created a hole for a USB MINI.</i>

<h3>3D Printing in the Ultimaker</h3>
<br>
<img src="images/Ultimaker in Lab.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="3D Printing in Lab">
<br><br>


<h4>Procedure</h4>
<p align="justify">
  The <i>STL</i> file is opened in the <b><u>Cura</u></b> slicing 3D printing application, where the part is viewed and set according to 
  the slicing pattern. The estimated print time can also be previewed. 
  <br><br>
  Then, a <i><u>GCode</u></i> file is generated, which is copied to an <i>SD Card</i> and inserted into the <b><u>Ultimaker</u></b>. 
  The printer interprets the GCode and prints the part by slicing hot plastic material layer-by-layer in the required pattern.

<h3>Business Model of the Project</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Nowadays, every product, especially highly proficient and technological, is in high demand. Our mission is to create an affordable, portable, and pocket-sized transistor tester that can be used in electronic labs to measure precise and accurate component values and characteristics. 
  <br><br>
  This tester is designed to be easier to use and more cost-effective than a digital multimeter. It also shows the schematic symbol, pin diagram in case of BJTs, FETs, and MOSFETs, and polarity in the case of diodes and capacitors.

<h1 id="C5">Conclusion</h1>
<p align="justify">
  In this course, we felt fortunate to learn many new things through self-learning. It must be said that this course proved to be different from the rest. We were free to apply our ideas and engage in challenging activities.
  <br><br>
  While working on this project, we learned about teamwork, coordination, and cooperation. Our technical concepts were reinforced and enhanced, and learning was continuous.
  <br><br>
  To sum up, this course was rich with practical experience and hands-on knowledge. We encourage all to take this opportunity with enthusiasm and dedication.
